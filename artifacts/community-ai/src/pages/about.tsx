        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          For decades, reporting local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, or illegal dumping meant navigating confusing municipality websites, waiting on hold, or filling out endless paper forms. Often, these reports disappeared into a bureaucratic void with no feedback loop for the citizen.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe civic engagement shouldn't feel like a chore. By leveraging modern artificial intelligence, we've created a platform that instantly understands the problem you're reporting, assesses its severity objectively, and routes it directly to the people equipped to fix it.
        </p>
