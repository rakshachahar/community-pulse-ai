# CommunityPulse AI

> **Making Communities Smarter Through AI-Powered Civic Intelligence**

CommunityPulse AI is an AI-powered civic issue reporting platform developed for the **Gen AI Academy APAC Hackathon** under the theme:

**AI for Better Living and Smarter Communities**

The platform enables citizens to report civic issues by uploading images and descriptions. Using Google's Gemini AI, the application analyzes reports, classifies issues, estimates severity, recommends responsible departments, and provides authorities with an analytics dashboard for smarter decision-making.
